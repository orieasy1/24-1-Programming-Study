# Integer Digits Addition

## Objective

Write a Java program that reads an integer between 0 and 999 and adds all the digits in the integer.

For example, if you give the number 611, the program should return the number 6 + 1 + 1 = 8


## Requirements

1. Create a Java application that prompts the user to enter a number.
2. Decompose the number in digits.
3. Add those digits and display the result using the `printf` function.

Hint: You can use one of the operators we learned in class.

## Notes:
### Javadoc comments
* Delimited by <span style="color:green; font-weight:bold;">/** and */</span>.
* All text between the Javadoc comment delimiters is ignored by the compiler.
* Enable you to embed program documentation directly in your programs.
