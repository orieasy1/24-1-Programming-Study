# Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator Exercise

## Objective

In this exercise, you will develop a Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator that reads the user's weight
and height, calculates their BMI, and displays it along with the [BMI categories from
the National Heart Lung](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmicalc.htm)
and Blood Institute. This exercise aims to enhance your understanding of basic
Java programming concepts, including input/output operations, arithmetic calculations, and
basic conditional statements.

## Background

Body Mass Index (BMI) is a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters.

### BMI Calculation Formula

- For kilograms and meters: $BMI = {weight in Kilograms  \over height in meters \times height in meters}$

## Requirements

1. Create a Java application that prompts the user to enter their weight and height. 
2. Calculate the user's BMI using the appropriate formula.
3. Display the calculated BMI.
4. Include the following BMI categories and their values as per the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute:

- Underweight: less than 18.5
- Obesity: BMI of 30 or greater

## Extra
For an extra challenge, try to add this categories

- Normal weight: 18.5–24.9
- Overweight: 25–29.9

## Notes:

### Javadoc comments 
* Delimited by <span style="color:green; font-weight:bold;">/** and */</span>. 
* All text between the Javadoc comment delimiters is ignored by the compiler. 
* Enable you to embed program documentation directly in your programs.
