# Simple Arithmetic Operations Exercise

## Objective
Write a Java program that reads two integers from the user and calculates their sum, difference, product, average, distance (absolute difference), maximum, and minimum.

## Instructions

1. Prompt the user to input two integers.
2. Calculate and display the following:
  - Sum
  - Difference
  - Product
  - Average 
  - Maximum (the larger of the two integers)
  - Minimum (the smaller of the two integers)
  - 
## Additional tasks

- Use the printf functions so the output is correctly formatted with 2 decimal positions for floating point numbers.
- Add the docstring to all arithmetic functions
  - Start by typing "/**" and then hitting Enter
