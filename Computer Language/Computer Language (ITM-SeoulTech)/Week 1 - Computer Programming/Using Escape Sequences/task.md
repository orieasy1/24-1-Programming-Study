Itâ€™s possible to display multiple lines of output with only one line of code. You just have to tell Java where to put the line breaks:

Common escape sequences

<li> \n	- newline  
<li> \t	- tab 
<li> \"	- double quote
<li> \\	- backslash

Task: Using only one statement, display two lines, in the first line you should output "Hello!" 
and in the second line you should output "How are you doing?"
