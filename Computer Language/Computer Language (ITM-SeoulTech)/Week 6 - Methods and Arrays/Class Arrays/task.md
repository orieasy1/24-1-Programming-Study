# Class Arrays

Class Arrays helps you avoid reinventing the wheel by providing static methods for
common array manipulations. 

These methods include:
* sort for sorting an array (i.e., arranging elements into ascending order), 

* binarySearch for searching a sorted array (i.e., determining whether an array contains a specific value and, if so, where the value is located),

* equals for comparing arrays and fill for placing values into an array.
