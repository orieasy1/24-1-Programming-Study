# Multidimensional Arrays
Multidimensional arrays with two dimensions often represent tables of values with data arranged
in rows and columns. 

To identify a particular table element, you specify two indices.

By convention, the first identifies the elementâ€™s row and the second its column. 

Arrays that require two indices to identify each element are called two-dimensional arrays.

A two-dimensional array b with two rows and two columns could be
declared and initialized with nested array initializers as follows:

`int[][] b = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}};`
