# Declaring methods

So far, each class we declared contained one method named `main`. Class `MaximumFinder` has two methods— `main` **(lines 6–22)** and `maximum` **(lines 25–39)**.

The `maximum` method determines and returns the largest of three double values. 

Recall that `main` is a special method that’s called automatically by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) when you execute an application. 

Most methods do not get called automatically. 

As you’ll soon see, you must call method `maximum` explicitly to tell it to perform its task.
