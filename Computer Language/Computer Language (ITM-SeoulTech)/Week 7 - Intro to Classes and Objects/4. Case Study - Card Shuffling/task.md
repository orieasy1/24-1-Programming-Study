# Case Study: Card Shuffling and Dealing Simulation

1. We first develop class `Card` (Fig. 7.11), which represents a playing card that has a face
(e.g., "Ace", "Deuce", "Three", …, "Jack", "Queen", "King") and a suit (e.g., "Hearts", "Diamonds", "Clubs", "Spades").

2. Next, we develop the `DeckOfCards` class (Fig. 7.12), which creates a deck of 52 playing cards in which each element is a `Card` object.

3. We then build a test application (Fig. 7.13) that demonstrates class DeckOfCards’s card shuffling
and dealing capabilities.
