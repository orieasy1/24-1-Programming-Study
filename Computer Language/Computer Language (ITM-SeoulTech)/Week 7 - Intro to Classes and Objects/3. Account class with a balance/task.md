# `Account` Class with a Balance

We now declare an `Account` class that maintains the balance of a bank account in addition
to the name. Most account balances are not integers. 

So, class `Account` represents the account balance as a double. 

Our next app contains an `Account` class  that maintains `name` and `balance` instance variables. 

A typical bank services many accounts, each with its own balance, so line
7 declares an instance variable `balance` of type `double`. Every instance (i.e., object) of class
`Account` contains its own copies of both the `name` and the `balance`.
