# Account Class: Initializing Objects with Constructors

As mentioned before, when an object of class `Account` is created, its
`String` instance variable name is initialized to `null` by default. 

But what if you want to provide a name when you create an `Account` object? 

* Each class you declare can optionally provide a constructor with parameters that can be used to initialize an object of a class when
the object is created. 
* ava requires a constructor call for every object that’s created, so this
is the ideal point to initialize an object’s instance variables.
